# Visual-Math

This is a Visualisation library (under development).

Currently there are very basic features available.

A very simple example of the current capacity of this library is show in the VM\wrapping_wave_func.py.
  In which we are forming two simple waves with domain [0, 4pi] and this graph is wrapped around the origin with a certain rotation frequency
  which is mentioned on the screen.
  The program draws frames from 1 to 9999 each with rotation frequency 0.001 greater than the previous one.
  All the frames formed are saved in the 

Soon we will add the documentations for better understandability.
