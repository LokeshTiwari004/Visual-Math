# Visual-Math

This is a visualization library (under development).
This is being developed using PyGAME.

Currently there are very basic features available.

A very simple example of the current capacity of this library is show in the VM\wrapping_wave_func.py.
  In which we are forming two simple waves with domain [0, 6pi] and this graph is wrapped around the origin with a certain rotation frequency
  which is mentioned on the screen.
  The program draws frames from 1 to 9999 each with rotation frequency 0.001 greater than the previous one.
  All the frames formed are saved in the VM\img_sequence folder.
  This image sequence is used to form the animation using the ffmpeg and as soon as the animation is formed( and saved in the few animations folder) the 
  image sequence is deleted.

Soon we will add the documentations for better understandability.
