# Visual-Math

This is a dummy of the visualization library (under development).
It is formed to get an overview of the project and using PyGame
 but the original library is formed
 on the top of openCV and ffmpeg.
The main project is under the repo named "drawingofmath".

Currently there are very basic features available.
